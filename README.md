# IMGUI BASE

---

A template project that includes batteries for GLFW, GLAD, and IMGUI using:

- Windows 10
- MSBuild (Visual Studio 2017)
- CMake
- Visual Studio Code


### Some notes:

- Make sure to have MSBuild.exe (found where Visual Studio is installed) on your PATH. That way the bash scripts can call MSBuild.exe without needing to know where it is.
- I use git bash on windows so that's what this is configured to work with
- CMake is necessary obv.
